### 🚀 The Big Upgrades in v2 🚀

- **Beyond Just Streams:** AIOStreams v2 now supports more than just stream addons! You can integrate **any supported Stremio addon type**, including **Catalog addons, Subtitle addons, and even Addon Catalog addons** into your single AIOStreams setup. Now it truly can do _everything_!
- **100% Addon Compatibility:** That's right! AIOStreams v2 is designed to work with **100% of existing Stremio addons** that adhere to the Stremio addon SDK.
- **Sleek New UI**: The entire interface has been redesigned for a more modern, intuitive, and frankly, beautiful configuration experience.

_This new configuration page was only possible thanks to [Seanime](https://seanime.rahim.app), a beautiful application for anime_

### ✨ Feature Deep Dive - Get Ready for Control! ✨

This rewrite has paved the way for a TON of new features and enhancements. Here’s a rundown:

**🛠️ Configuration Heaven & Built-in Marketplace:**

- The configuration page now features a **built-in marketplace for addons**. This makes it super easy to discover and add new addons, displaying their supported resources (streams, catalogs, subtitles, etc.), Debrid services they integrate with, and stream types (torrent, http, usenet, live etc.).
- You can now **quickly enable or disable individual addons** within your AIOStreams setup without fully removing them. This is particularly useful because tools like StremThru Sidekick wouldn't be able to detect or manage the individual addons _inside_ your AIOStreams bundle, but with AIOStreams' own UI, you have that fine-grained control.
- Remember, the marketplace is just there for convenience. You can still add any addon you want using the 'Custom' addon at the top of the marketplace and use an addons manifest URL to add it to AIOStreams.

**📚 Supercharged Catalog Management:**

- **Total Catalog Control:** Reorder your catalogs exactly how you want them, **regardless of which addon they originate from!** Mix and match to your heart's content.
- **Granular Management:** Enable/disable specific catalogs, apply **shuffling** to individual catalogs - and control how long a shuffle lasts, **rename catalogs** for a personalized touch, and you can even **disable certain catalogs from appearing on your Stremio home page**, having them only show up in the Discover section for a cleaner look!
- **Universal RPDB Posters:** Ever wanted those sleek posters with ratings on _any_ catalog? Now you can! Apply **RPDB posters (with ratings) to any addon that uses a supported ID type (like IMDB or TMDB ID), even if the original addon doesn't support RPDB itself.** Yes, this means you could add RPDB posters to Cinemeta if you wanted!
- **Why not just use other tools like StremThru Sidekick or the Addon Manager for catalogs?**
  - **Broader Compatibility:** Both StremThru Sidekick and Addon Manager are primarily limited to managing addons _for Stremio itself_. AIOStreams’ catalog features can be utilized by _any application_ that supports Stremio addons, not just Stremio.
  - **True Internal Reordering:** Neither of those tools supports reordering catalogs _within an addon itself_. Since AIOStreams presents all its combined catalogs as coming from _one addon_, those tools wouldn't be able to reorder the catalogs _inside_ your AIOStreams setup. AIOStreams gives you that crucial internal control.
  - **Safety:** AIOStreams does **not** make use of the Stremio API for its core functionality. This means it operates independently and **cannot break your Stremio account** or interfere with its settings.

**🌐 Expanded Addon Ecosystem:**

- The built-in marketplace comes packed with **many more addons than before**.
- Some notable new stream addons include: **StremThru Torz, Nuvio Streams, Debridio Watchtower, StreamFusion**, and even built-in support for **wrapping AIOStreams within AIOStreams** (AIOception!).

**💎 Revolutionary Grouping Feature:**

- This is a big one! I've implemented a **new grouping feature** that allows you to group your addons and apply highly customizable conditions.
- Streams from addons in Group 1 are always fetched. Then, you can set conditions for subsequent groups. For example, for Group 2, you could set a condition like `count(previousStreams) < 5`. This means addons in Group 2 will only be queried if the total number of streams found by Group 1 is less than 5. This means you can tell AIOStreams, for instance, to only tap into your backup/slower addon group if your main, preferred addons don't find enough streams first – super efficient!
- This allows for incredibly optimized and tailored stream fetching. (For more advanced setups and details, I highly recommend checking out the **[Wiki](https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams/wiki/Groups)**).

**🔎 Next-Level Filtering System:**

- The filtering system has been completely revamped. Previously, you could mainly exclude or prefer. Now, for _every_ filter criteria, you can set **four different filter types**:
  - **Include:** If matched, this item won't be excluded by other exclude/required filters for _any other exclude/required filter_.
  - **Required:** Exclude the stream if this criteria is _not_ detected.
  - **Exclude:** Exclude the stream if this criteria _is_ detected.
  - **Preferred:** This is used for ranking when you use that filter as a sort criteria.
- **New Filters Added:**
  - **Conditions Filter:** This incredibly flexible filter uses the same powerful condition parser as the "Groups" feature. You can now enter **multiple filter conditions**, and any stream that matches _any_ of the conditions you define will be filtered out. This allows for an almost infinite number of ways to combine and exclude streams with surgical precision! For example, a condition like `addon(type(streams, 'debrid'), 'TorBox')` would exclude all Debrid-type streams _only_ from the "TorBox" addon, leaving its Usenet streams untouched.
  - **Matching:** This powerful filter helps ensure you get the right content. It includes:
    - **Title Matching:** Filter out results that don't match the requested title. You can choose between an "exact match" mode or a "contains" mode for flexibility. **You can optionally also match the year too.**
    - **Season/Episode Matching:** Specifically for series, this mode filters out results with incorrect season or episode numbers, ensuring accuracy. This can be granularly applied to only specific addons or request types.
  - **Audio Channels:** This was previously part of the Audio Tag filter but is now its own dedicated filter for more precise control (e.g., filter for 5.1, 7.1).
  - **Seeders:** Define include/required/exclude ranges for seeders. Finally, you can set a **minimum seeder count** and automatically exclude results below that threshold!
- **Adjusted & Enhanced Filters:**
  - **Cache:** Get fine-grained control over cached/uncached content. You can now exclude uncached/cached content from specific Debrid services or addons, and even for specific stream types. For example, you could filter out all uncached _torrents_ but still allow uncached _Usenet_ results.
  - **Clean Results (now "Deduplicator"):** This is now far more customizable! You can modify what attributes are used to identify duplicates (e.g., infohash, filename) and how duplicates are removed for each stream type. For instance, for cached results, you might want one result from each of your Debrid services, while for uncached results, you might only want the single best result from your highest priority service.
  - **Size:** You can now set **individual file size ranges for each resolution** (e.g., 1-2GB for 720p, 3-5GB for 1080p, etc.).

**📺 Smarter Sorting & Display:**

- Define **different sorting priorities for cached vs. uncached media**, and also **different sorting for movies vs. series.**
- **New "Light GDrive" Formatter:** For those who prefer a cleaner look but still need key information from the filename, this formatter only shows the title, year, and season/episode info (e.g., "Movie Title (2023) S01E01"), making sure you don't potentially choose an incorrect result while still keeping the text to a minimal level.
  - And of course, you can always join our Discord server to discover custom display formats shared by the community and easily use them with AIOStreams' custom formatter feature!

**✨ Quality of Life Enhancements:**

- **Import/Export Configurations:** You can now easily **export your entire AIOStreams configuration into a file.** This file can then be imported into any AIOStreams instance at any time – perfect for backups or migrating to a new setup.
  - **Shareable Templates:** There's an "Exclude Credentials" option when exporting, making it easy to share template configurations with others!
  - **⚠️ Important Warning:** While the "Exclude Credentials" feature removes sensitive information you enter _directly_ into AIOStreams (like API keys), it **does not** modify or exclude URLs you provide for "Custom" addons or when you override an addon's default URL. These URLs can potentially contain sensitive tokens or identifiers, so please review them carefully before sharing a configuration file.
- **External Downloads:** For added convenience, AIOStreams v2 now adds an "External Download" link below each stream result. Clicking this will open the direct download link for that stream in your browser, making it easy to grab a copy of the content if needed.
- **Hide Errors:** Optionally hide error messages, and you can even specify this for particular resources (e.g., hide errors only for stream fetching, but show them for catalog fetching).
- **Precache Next Episode:** When you're watching a series, AIOStreams can automatically request results for the _next_ episode in the background. If it finds that all available results are uncached, it can **ping the first uncached result for your preferred Debrid service to start downloading it.** The goal? By the time you finish your current episode, the next one might already be cached and ready to stream instantly!

**A Note on Options:** AIOStreams v2 offers a vast array of configuration options, especially within the filtering system. While this provides incredible power and flexibility for advanced users, please remember that **most users won't need to dive deep into every setting.** The default configurations are designed to be sensible and provide a great experience out-of-the-box! For a detailed explanation of every option and how to fine-tune your setup, the **[AIOStreams v2 Configuration Guide](https://guides.viren070.me/stremio/addons/aiostreams)** has been fully updated and is your best resource.

---

### 💾 Under The Hood: The New Database Foundation 💾

- **Database-Driven:** AIOStreams is now database-based! This means your configurations are stored securely. When you create a configuration, it's assigned a **unique UUID** that you'll use to access it in Stremio.
- **Password Protected:** You'll protect your configurations with a **password**. Without it, no one else can access your configuration.
- **Seamless Updates (Mostly!):** A huge benefit of being database-driven is that for most setting changes, there’s **no longer a need to reinstall the addon in Stremio!** Just update your configuration, and the changes apply automatically.
  - **Note:** The only exception is if you make changes to your catalogs that affect their order or which addons provide them (e.g., reordering addons in the list, adding/removing catalog-providing addons). In this specific case, a reinstall of the AIOStreams addon in Stremio is needed for Stremio to pick up the new catalog structure.

---

### ⚠️ Important Notes & Caveats for v2 ⚠️

- **Migration Requires Reconfiguration:** Due to the extensive changes and the new database system, existing AIOStreams users will need to **reconfigure their setups for v2.** Think of it as a fresh start with a much more powerful system! The **[v1 to v2 Migration Guide](https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams/wiki/Migrate-to-V2)** on the Wiki can help. For a deep dive into all the new settings, refer to the comprehensive **[AIOStreams v2 Configuration Guide](https://guides.viren070.me/stremio/addons/aiostreams)**. **If you use custom formatters, you should also check the migration guide for minor syntax adjustments.**
- **Torrentio support (on public instance)?** Torrentio, the most popular addon, was disabled for most of v1's history due to the way it works (multiple requests appear to come from one IP, which is problematic for public instances). Torrentio remains **disabled on the public instance**, and this will not change. Self-hosted instances will have Torrentio enabled by default. The developer of Torrentio has personally stated that he does not want ElfHosted's public instances scraping Torrentio.
- **Cloudflare Worker Support Dropped:** Maintaining compatibility with Cloudflare Workers alongside the new database requirements and feature set became infeasible. It was essentially like writing and maintaining two different versions of the addon. As such, direct Cloudflare Worker support has been dropped.
- **Free Hosting Challenges:** AIOStreams v2 now **requires a database** for storing configurations. Many free hosting services do not provide persistent database storage (or have very limited free tiers), which can lead to your configurations being wiped when the instance restarts.
  - For example, **Hugging Face Spaces** requires a paid tier for persistent storage.
  - **Koyeb's** free tier does not offer persistent file storage for the SQLite database, however, Koyeb _does_ provide a free PostgreSQL database instance which AIOStreams v2 can use, offering a viable free hosting path if configured correctly.
    I recommend looking for hosting solutions that offer persistent storage or a compatible free database tier if you plan to self-host on a free platform.

### 🔧 Self-Hosting AIOStreams & Self-Hosting Guides 🔧

For those of you who like to have full control over your setup, **AIOStreams v2 is, of course, _still_ self-hostable!**

If you're migrating your instance from v1 to v2, read the [Migration](https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams/wiki/Migrate-to-V2) page on the Wiki to ensure nothing unexpected happens.

A few months back, I started out knowing very little about self-hosting (I was using Hugging Face to host my personal AIOStreams instance back then) and I've since decided to dive into self-hosting.

As a result, I've put together a **set of comprehensive self-hosting guides** that I'm excited to share with the community. My goal with these guides is to take you **from scratch to hosting all sorts of addons and applications**, including AIOStreams, without spending a dime or needing any hardware other than a laptop/computer. (Some of you may even be able to set this all up just using your phone/tablet)

The guides cover:

- Securing a **free Oracle Cloud VPS** (yes, free!).
- Installing **Docker** and getting comfortable with its basics.
- Utilizing my **highly flexible and detailed template compose project.** This Docker Compose setup is designed to be a launchpad for your self-hosting adventures and includes configurations for **countless apps, with AIOStreams v2 ready to go!**

If you've ever been curious about self-hosting but didn't know where to start, I believe these guides can help you get up and running with a powerful, remote, and secure setup.
